# Training Plan Templates

This document outlines the original training plan templates we'll create for the app. These are designed from training science principles, not copied from any copyrighted source.

---

## Training Philosophy

All templates follow these evidence-based principles:

1. **Progressive Overload** - Gradual increase in training stress
2. **Specificity** - Training that mimics race demands
3. **Recovery** - Adequate rest between hard efforts
4. **Periodization** - Structured phases (base → build → peak → taper)
5. **Individuality** - Customizable to user preferences

## Pace Calculation

We'll use established formulas to provide pace guidance:

### Based on Recent Race Time
- **Marathon pace** from half-marathon: HM time × 2.1
- **Easy pace:** Marathon pace + 60-90 seconds/mile
- **Tempo pace:** Marathon pace - 20-30 seconds/mile
- **Interval pace:** Based on equivalent 5K/10K times

### Based on Perceived Effort (if no race data)
- Easy: 4-5 out of 10
- Tempo: 7-8 out of 10
- Intervals: 9-10 out of 10
- Marathon pace: 6-7 out of 10

### Calculator Integration
Consider adding a pace calculator that takes:
- A recent race time (any distance)
- Outputs: Easy, Marathon, Tempo, Interval paces
- Updates workout descriptions with specific pace targets

## Implementation Notes

1. **Each template is a function** that takes race date and outputs full workout schedule
2. **Customizations applied as overrides** - base template + user preferences
3. **Workout descriptions are original** - not copied from any source
4. **Pacing guidance uses standard formulas** - public domain sports science
5. **All templates include rest day flexibility** - users can shift schedule

*These templates will be refined based on user feedback and testing*
